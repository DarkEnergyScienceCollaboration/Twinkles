<h1>Twinkles Weekly: February 16, 2017</h1>
<p>We digested our Twinkles 1 results and identified some action items. Then we looked at our Twinkles 2 Plans, and identified issues to resolve and features to add.</p>
<h2 id="twinkles-1-results"><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yIKGfGDaX50rszZrudDTA78nV27fxhcvb9NGc-W_uIw/edit#slide=id.p"><strong><em>Twinkles 1 Results</em></strong></a></h2>
<p>Discussions:</p>
<p>Phil:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Center of field …not exposed to flat fielding problems</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Big Dithers ?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Should DC2 be combined Twinkles for PhoSim Deep analogs ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Things like flat fielding will be done in PhoSim Deep. So focussing on a chip without these problems is important</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Tom :</p>
<p>Why did we turn off Clouds? : not turned on because the variation seemed large and wanted to start simple. A Also at that point we were not doing spatially varying zeropoints which is being worked on now.</p>
<p>Long jobs: (these were 2109 jobs that were predicted to take too long to run based on a model of Run 1.1.)</p>
<p>Is it ok to not have these nights in the analysis? Probably … will say that we have explored parameter regions.</p>
<p>Twinkles Metadata:</p>
<p>We should produce a catalog/database of all of the single-number parameters characterizing PhoSim runs so that we can diagnose why long runs fail.</p>
<p>Use cases:</p>
<p>Correlate execution time with moon parameters</p>
<p>Correlate processCCD execution time with PhoSim execution time.</p>
<p>Correlate processCCD execution time with number of input sources</p>
<p>Correlate processCCD execution time with PhoSim seeing and DM measured seeing</p>
<p>Correlate DM failures with properties of PhoSim runs</p>
<p>What are the last 10 lines of the failure. What’s the link to the full output.</p>
<p>How many</p>
<p>These all should be accessible with a simple “one-line” query call suitable for implementation by a variety of quick scripts. This information should be easily available to DESC members with no more than 2 minutes required to look up the information and no external help or additional authorization required beyond having a NERSC account.</p>
<p>Parameters to track:</p>
<p>Number of sources in InstanceCatalog</p>
<p>PhoSim header entries</p>
<p>brightest source(?)</p>
<p>Should we have this for other projects too? Probably yes</p>
<p>CModel fluxes is on the basis of bulge or disk (using best fit)</p>
<p>Action Item: Turn on moments</p>
<p>Visit images : the images thrown out are less than 1 percent of the images. &lt; 0.6 seeing. What is the median ?</p>
<p>How can we get the workflow tool on a local machine? Why ? For example there are loops in the DM functions that won’t be available to a workflow…</p>
<p>Decision: difference images against DR1 templates only.</p>
<p>Possible problem: there do not appear to be u-band images in year 1</p>
