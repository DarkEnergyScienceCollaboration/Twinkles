# Twinkles: Science Goals, Survey Design and Development Methodology

*Phil Marshall (SLAC) and the Twinkles Task Force*

A necessary condition for accurate cosmography is a demonstration that
input cosmological parameters can be recovered in a "round trip" test on
realistic mock data. Twinkles is a project to partially fulfill this
condition for the two LSST DESC time domain probes, type Ia supernovae
and strong lens time delays. It involves simulating a 10-year
multi-filter LSST sky survey of a tiny (100 square arcmin) patch of sky
that has been "sprinkled" with an over-abundance of supernovae and
strong lenses, and then processing the images using LSST DM stack
software and analyzing the resulting catalogs. The project has two
phases, corresponding to the DC1 and DC2 LSST DESC data challenge eras,
enabling a staged progression in dataset realism and analysis
sophistication. Twinkles 1 focuses on the problem of accurate light
curve extraction in annual release (level 2) data. Its small dataset size but end-to-end nature make Twinkles useful as a "pathfinder" for other LSST DESC data challenge datasets.

To add figures, add the required image file (PNG, SVG or JPG preferred)
to the `_static` subdirectory in your Note's folder. Here's an example:

This is the figure caption: above we have the LSST DESC logo, in PNG format.

And then the text continues. Note that GitHub ignores the image sizing
commands when presenting markdown format documents; Sphinx might not.

You can cite papers (or anything else) by providing hyperlinks. For
example, you might have been impressed by the DESC White Paper [(LSST
Dark Energy Science Collaboration
