    "    template](https://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/ComputingInfrastructure/blob/master/doc/LSST_DESC_Notes/template_LSST_DESC_Note.rst) (i.e.\n",

    "-   Edit your new index.rst file with the contents of your Note,\n",
    "    following the guidelines in the template.\n",
    "-   Add files for figures in a subfolder called \\_static.\n",
    "-   When your Note is complete and ready for review, submit a Pull\n",
    "    Request to the base repo and ask your project's leads and/or your\n",
    "    working group's conveners to review it.\n",
