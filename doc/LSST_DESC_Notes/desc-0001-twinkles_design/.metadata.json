    "description": "Accurate cosmography demands a demonstration, on plausibly realistic mock data, that astrophysical input parameters can be recovered in an end-to-end test.
    Twinkles is a project to partially fulfill this condition for the two LSST DESC time domain probes, type Ia supernovae and strong lens time delays.
    We are simulating a 10-year multi-filter LSST sky survey of a tiny (c.\ 200 square arcmin) patch of sky that has been ``sprinkled'' with an over-abundance of supernovae and strong lenses, processing the images using LSST DM stack software and then analyzing the resulting catalogs.
    During this process we aim to learn an ``error model,'' that defines the density function that could be used as the likelihood of the paramters given LSST cataloged flux measurements, and the sampling distribution in a catalog-level mock data generator.
    We envision the Twinkles project having at least two phases, corresponding to the DC1 and DC2 LSST DESC data challenge eras, that  enable a staged progression in dataset realism and analysis sophistication.
    Twinkles 1 focuses on the problem of accurate light curve extraction in annual release (Level 2) data.
    Its small dataset size but end-to-end nature make Twinkles useful as a ``pathfinder'' for the generation of other LSST DESC data challenge datasets.",
