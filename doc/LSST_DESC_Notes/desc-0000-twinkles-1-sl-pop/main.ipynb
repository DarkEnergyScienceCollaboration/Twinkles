    "The lens system catalog used by Twinkles is found in the data folder of the repository and is labeled as [twinkles_lenses_v2.fits](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/blob/master/data/twinkles_lenses_v2.fits). We started by selecting the subset of 872 OM10 lenses that made up rung 4 in the [Strong Lens Time Delay Challenge](http://timedelaychallenge.org/index.html) ([Liao et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1254)). This set was chosen since it matches the LSST best (discussed in issue [#117](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/issues/117)).  **Question for PJM: What does matches LSST best mean?** However, the original OM10 catalog is incomplete and lacks sizes for the foreground lens galaxies. In addition, our image simulations require an SED for the lens galaxy of each system. Therefore, we decided to assign stellar masses to our OM10 lens galaxies based upon SL2S data and then use this information to assign an SED and radial size from an appropriate CATSIM galaxy.\n",

    "\n",
    "We performed the matching using code in a jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/blob/master/examples/notebooks/MatchingLensGalaxies.ipynb). The process involved three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use SL2S data to generate a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to estimate stellar mass of lens galaxies based upon redshift and velocity dispersion.\n",
    "    * We use the data from Table 3 of [Sonnenfeld et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4759).\n",
    "    * Derive the GMM using the [XDGMM](https://github.com/tholoien/XDGMM) and [empriciSN](https://github.com/tholoien/empiriciSN) packages by Tom Holoien.\n",
    "2. Assign a stellar mass to the OM10 systems based upon this GMM and the OM10 redshifts and velocity dispersions.\n",
    "3. Use the updated OM10 catalog with stellar masses, redshifts and ellipticities to match against CATSIM galaxies and use best fit galaxies to add SED and radius information to OM10 catalog.\n",
    "    * Matched OM10 galaxies to CATSIM galaxies with a 20% error limit on the three matching parameters.\n",
    "    * 11 OM10 lens galaxies did not have matches within 20% in all three parameters to a CATSIM galaxy. These were not included in the final catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the matching process we had a final catalog of 861 OM10 systems with additional size and SED information needed to generate images. This final catalog was then used as the input for `The Sprinkler`."
