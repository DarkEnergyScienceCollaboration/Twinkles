# Lessons learned from Run 1

* Getting all the astrometry right is hard.  There are differential effects we want to simulate with catsim so things move around correctly.  Unfortunately, we found that bulk precession ended up in the WCS produced by phosim which made our reference catalogs useless.
* It took me a while to figure out how to get to the data in a place where I could look at it.  This was mostly just figuring out which machine to use and paths to the data and stack.  Maybe Tony's concept of a portal will help this.
