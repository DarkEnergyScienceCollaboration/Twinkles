Twinkles simulations must be reproducible - which means laying out a transparent, openly-accessible software pipeline which can be run by anyone. We can achieve this by developing several installations in parallel, for example at SLAC, NERSC and Fermilab, and maintaining various test examples that must always *just run*.

The flow chart below shows the current pipeline design, color coded to show what remains to be built in red.
