These are script versions of the notebooks that are used
to create sprinkler inputs based upon the cosmoDC2 catalogs
and the OM10 and Gravitationally Lensed SNe catalogs.

Putting these into an easier to use pipeline is still a work
in progress but these will run the same code as the notebooks:

* MatchingLensGalaxies.ipynb
  * Script: add_glsn_properties.py
* MatchingLensGalaxies-SN.ipynb
  * Script: add_om10_properties.py
