This directory contains the "config" area of the working directory
tree for SLAC Pipeline task TW-phoSim-r3.  

In real life, this directory will exist as
/nfs/farm/g/desc/u1/Pipeline-tasks/TW-phoSim-r3/config.

Neighboring directories will contain: phoSim output, log files,
directories for special task-related tests, and a reference copy of
the Twinkles git project.


Contents of this directory:


task.xml - defines workflow task

--- Data files

sensorList.txt - list of sensors to be simulated
twinkles_visits.txt  - list of obsHistIDs to simulate (output of Twinkles/bin/get_twinkles_visits.py)
phoSim_commands.txt - template command (physics overrides) file read by phoSim


--- Main Pipeline task scripts

setupVisit.py - initial setup for processing a single visit, including identifying the obsHistID
setupPhoSim.jy - create one substream per sensor
  phoSimPrep.sh - set up environment to run phoSimPrep.py
  phoSimPrep.py - perform any potentially lengthy preparatory steps prior to running phoSim
  runPhoSim.py - run phoSim
  phoSimReg.py - register phoSim data products in dataCatalog
  phoSimFinalize.jy - [no-op placeholder] for preparing single sensor data needed downstream
wrapUp.jy - [no-op] for collecting data from all sub-streams
wrapUp.py - [no-op] for summarizing data from all sub-streams (single visit)

--- Imports

config.py - common configuration used by some/all python scripts in task
setupPhoSimInput.py - class to handle setting up of phoSim inputs and working environment
registry.py - class to register files in dataCatalog

--- /helpers -- miscellaneous scripts needed at some point in the
    past.  Not required for production.

--- Preparation

A list of obsHistIDs must be created prior to running this task.  For
Twinkles Run 3, first establish the Twinkles execution environment by
sourcing the config/helpers/TWsetup.sh.  Next, the obsHistID
generation command looks like this:



$TWINKLES_DIR/bin/get_twinkles_visits.py /nfs/farm/g/desc/u1/data/Twinkles/minion_1016_sqlite.db

This command may take quite some time to run (~15 min).  It produces
the following file: twinkles_visits_fieldID_1427.txt
